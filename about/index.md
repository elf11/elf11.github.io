title: About Me
---

I'm Oana Niculaescu and I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts Boston, USA.  I hold a BS degree in Computer Science from the University Politehnica of Bucharest. My research interest are in data privacy and especially in differential privacy and Privacy-Preserving Measurement of High-Speed Network Data.


In my spare time you can find me hacking away, practicing Tae Kwon Do, 
in the gym, hiking, reading the latest news on technology and pondering if we are going to be overthrown by AI or just relaxing with friends.
