title: About Me
---

I'm [Oana Niculaescu][github] and I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts Boston, USA.  I hold a BS degree in Computer Science from the [University Politehnica of Bucharest][upb]. My research interest are in data privacy and especially in differential privacy and Privacy-Preserving Measurement of High-Speed Network Data.


In my spare time you can find me hacking away, practicing Tae Kwon Do, 
in the gym, hiking, relaxing with friends, reading the latest news on technology, and pondering if we are going to be overthrown by AI. I am also spending some of my time helping high school students achieve their goals with the awesome people of the [Enroot][root] organization. I am passionate about open source communities and helping others get a break in the tech industry, so I am spending a couple of hours every week mentoring a woman interested in learning programming through the [Learn IT, Girl!](girl). If you want to be a part of it be on the lookout they are always wanting more mentors.

I am honored to be part of the [ACM XRDS magazine][xrds] as a department editor.
